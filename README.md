# About Me

I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in internet technologies and a particular focus on cybersecurity. My academic and personal projects reflect a commitment to understanding how systems work, how they can be secured, and how they interact at scale. I am especially interested in network security, secure software development, and the application of digital technologies in real-world environments.

In parallel with my technical education, I hold a microcredential in soft skills, which has enhanced my ability to collaborate, communicate effectively, and adapt to team-based work environments.
