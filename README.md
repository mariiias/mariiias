## About Me

I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in internet technologies and a growing specialization in cybersecurity.  
My academic background and personal projects demonstrate a commitment to understanding how digital systems operate, how they can be protected, and how they integrate into large-scale environments.

I am particularly interested in **network security**, **systems administration**, and the practical use of **geospatial tools** and **digital twins** in smart environments. I also hold a **microcredential in soft skills**, supporting effective collaboration, problem-solving, and professional communication.
